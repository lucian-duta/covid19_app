# Welcome to the covid-19_app wiki!

As the world has become more reliant on using applications on a day to day basis, the importance of
reliable API’s has become evident, as they allow businesses to seamlessly interact with 3rd party data with
efficient data processing at a low cost.

> Due to its scalability, independence, flexibility and portability REST
> API’s have become a favourite amongst developers, with 83% choosing REST compared to 15% using
> SOAP, over 107 public endpoints, 58 beta endpoints, 28,000 individual instances, and 1.6 Billion+ API Calls,
> between September 2016 and March 2017 (Motroc, 2017).

For this reason, a REST API is the obvious
choice for developing a REST API prototype.

For this assignment we will be using the MERN stack over the MEAN stack, as Facebook’s React suits better
for this project than Google’s Angular. Although both stacks are reliable for lightweight Javascript
applications, and MEAN works extremely well for larger scaled applications, “MERN stack leads the race
in the faster development of smaller applications” (Sancheti, 2020).
For this assignment we have been tasked with creating a REST API prototype for Covid19 data in a given
CSV file with full connectivity across the 3 tier architecture. The user will be able to view, add or amend
the data, as well as being able to search for the first 20 records by date and state, return states where
the number of cases is more than the users given value, and return the server’s information.
